# Python Web Scraping Projects

Welcome to the **Python Web Scraping Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of web scraping projects that I have developed using Python. Each project demonstrates different web scraping techniques and approaches, using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium`.

## Overview

Web scraping is a powerful technique for extracting data from websites. This repository is intended to help developers, data enthusiasts, and beginners get started with various web scraping tasks using Python.

## Projects

- **Project 1: Scraping Books**
  - This project demonstrates how to scrape books data from a website using `BeautifulSoup`. It extracts details like book title, price, stock, rating and link.

- **Project 2: Scraping Quotes**
  - In this project, I scrape famous quotes from a website. The goal is to collect quote, author, tags and tag_links using `BeautifulSoup` for parsing the HTML.

- **Project 3: Scraping IMDB Top 250 Movies & TV Shows**
  - This project scrapes the top 250 movies and TV shows from IMDB using a combination of `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`. It retrieves information such as poster, title, year, duration, rating and vote.


More projects will be added over time.

## Requirements

First create a python virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Each project will have its own set of requirements, but generally, you'll need the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 selenium tqdm
